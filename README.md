Project Abstract
This includes the experimental vision-based Forward Collision Avoidance System [FORCAS]. An autonomous bot car based on machine learning using Raspberry Pi as a processing platform. Using HD camera images as a primary input, Raspberry PI combines, processes and predict path using convolutional neural network (CNN) and distance estimation models. It will distinguish the stationary objects on a drivable road surface and estimate their distances from a single cameraâ€™s view. Classification Algorithms run on real-time images controls the steering of the car. On the basis of a detected object, it decides to avoid, stop or run over it.
